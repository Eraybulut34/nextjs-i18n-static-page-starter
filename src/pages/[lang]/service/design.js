              <h2>Meb Shop Drawing Services</h2>
              <h3>MEP Shop Drawing Services | HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing, Fire</h3>
              <p>A mechanical, electrical, plumbing (MEP) coordinated shop drawing is a combined 3D rendering of the construction project by integrating all architectural, structural and trades shop drawings. A drawing or a set of drawings, which are required for prefabricated components like trusses, elevators, structural steel, windows, cabinets, appliances, mill-work, and air handling units and produced by the contractor, supplier, manufacturer, fabricator, or sub-contractors, are called shop drawings.</p>
              <p>An MEP HVAC shop drawing is the drawn version of the information in the construction documents. It includes dimensions, manufacturing standards, fabrication and contains more details compared to construction documents.</p>
              <p>An MEP shop drawing that emphasizes a particular product or installation has a very different style from that of the architectâ€™s drawing.</p>
              <h3>Coordinated MEP shop drawings provide support for design-build projects in various areas like:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Electrical component technical drawings</li>
                <li>Composite drawings</li>
                <li>Underground and above-ceiling coordination</li>
                <li>Coordinated shop drawings</li>
                <li>Sheet metal drawings</li>
                <li>Pipe fabrication drawings</li>
                <li>HVAC shop drawings</li>
                <li>Duct shop drawings</li>
                <li>Plumbing construction shop drawings</li>
                <li>Fabrication Drawing</li>
                <li>Plumbing Shop Drawing</li>
                <li>Mechanical piping detail drawings</li>
                <li>Mechanical room HVAC detailed drawings</li>
                <li>Equipment Placement</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Why Use MEP Coordinated Shop Drawings?</h3>
              <p>Using Revit family creation services, many more items like curtain wall panels, ceilings, furniture, fixtures, counters, plumbing fixtures, electrical fixtures, machine parts, elevators, insulators, and HVAC pumps can be created.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The MEP coordinated shop drawings that include HVAC, electrical, plumbing, piping, and duct-work layout drawings, enable engineers to create better fabrication drawings, installation, schedule trades, and other activities related to construction.</li>
                <li>These drawings ensure that each contractor gets a place for his system which needs to be installed in a structure.</li>
                <li>It allows extraction and manipulation of data for trades and contributors and increases the accuracy of the building design and delivery process.</li>
                <li>It enhances building quality and productivity through improved off-site fabrication, enhanced plans, and better-informed trade crews.
                Potential problems are identified before fabrication and installation on the job site. It enables to view the building project as a whole than as a separate drawing.</li>
                <li>It provides the client cost savings of around 50% and improvements in delivery schedules of over 40%.</li>
              </ul>
